## Project task
Project task was to build a tip calculator that divides the total amount of the bill + tip and the tip alone per person number inserted. Also the user should be able to pick the tip percentage or put in his custom one.

## Project overview
This project seemed fun to me since it requires to work in JavaScript for it and I'm trying to work on my JavaScript skills. First I designed the main box with all the info and then I went on to making the functionality and making the calculator actually work. I managed to go through it all without any bigger problems. Main issue I've encountered was with the custom tip amount, had a little trouble implementing it but managed to find my way around it and fix it.

Design has some flaws that could be worked on, but they are minor and don't affect the functionality.
